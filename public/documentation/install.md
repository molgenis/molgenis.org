**
You can download, install and use MOLGENIS for free under license [LGPLv3](). We here document three approaches: (1) install using apache-tomcat, (2) install using maven cargo or (3) install by compiling the code yourself
**

# Using apache-tomcat
The three components needed to run MOLGENIS locally or on a server are:

* [apache-tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) 
* MOLGENIS v1.21.5 or lower: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
* MOLGENIS v2.0 or higher: [PostGreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* The WAR for the [latest molgenis-app release](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.molgenis%22%20AND%20a%3A%22molgenis-app%22) from maven central.

Deploy apache-tomcat, and place the molgenis-app WAR as the ROOT.war in your apache-tomcat/webapps folder. If you are unfamiliar with apache-tomcat, follow one of their [apache-tomcat installation guides](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/deployer-howto.html).

Now that your apache-tomcat is running and MOLGENIS is deployed, you will notice it will not work yet. This is because your database needs to be configured, and a single properties file needs to be set.

**Setting your molgenis-server.properties**   
The properties file supplies information to the application regarding the database URL, and the initial administrator password. To make it clear to tomcat where to find your properties file, you have to edit the setenv.sh file in the apache-tomcat folder.

```
echo 'CATALINA_OPTS="-Xmx2g -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -Dmolgenis.home=${molgenis_home_folder}"' > ${apache-tomcat_folder}/bin/setenv.sh
```

The **-Dmolgenis.home** property tells tomcat where to find your properties file. Replace the ${molgenis_home_folder} with the location of your molgenis home. Note that you should **NOT** use relative paths in your apache-tomcat configuration. Always use absolute paths to point to your molgenis-server.properties.

Inside the specified molgenis home folder, create a file called *molgenis-server.properties*, and depending on the version of your MOLGENIS, write the following:

**MOLGENIS v1.21.5 or lower**

```
	db_user=molgenis  
	db_password=molgenis  
	db_uri=jdbc:mysql://localhost/molgenis  
	admin.password=admin  
	user.password=admin  
```

**MOLGENIS v2.0 or higher**

```
	db_user=molgenis  
	db_password=molgenis  
	db_uri=jdbc\:postgresql\://localhost/molgenis?reWriteBatchedInserts=true&autosave=CONSERVATIVE
	admin.password=admin  
	user.password=admin  
```


Remember the *molgenis* specified in your db_uri, because this will be the name of the database you will create later on in either MySQL or PostGreSQL. This effectively means that whatever you call your database, your db_uri should point to it.


To make it clear to tomcat where to find your properties file, you have to edit the setenv.sh file in the apache-tomcat folder.

```
	echo 'CATALINA_OPTS="-Dmolgenis.home=${molgenis_home_folder}"' > ${apache-tomcat_folder}/bin/setenv.sh
```

The *-Dmolgenis.home* property tells tomcat where to find your properties file.

**Setting up your MySQL**  
If you are unfamiliar with MySQL, follow one of their [MySQL installation guides](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/windows-installation.html). Once you have a MySQL server running, login as admin user and type the following commands:

```
	create database molgenis;  
	grant all privileges on molgenis.* to molgenis@localhost identified by 'molgenis';  
	flush privileges;  
```

To allow MOLGENIS to connect to MySQL, you also need to add a MySQL connector to your apache-tomcat lib folder.

```
cd ${apache-tomcat_folder}/lib/
wget http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.28/mysql-connector-java-5.1.28.jar
```

**Setting up your PostGreSQL**  
If you are unfamiliar with PostGreSQL, follow one of their [PostGreSQL installation guides](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/index.html). Once you have a PostGreSQL server running, open up the included pgAdmin application that is supplied with most PostGreSQL installations, and perform the following actions:

- Add a database 'molgenis'
- Add a user 'molgenis' (password 'molgenis') under Login Roles
- Add 'can create databases' privilege to user 'molgenis'

Now that your database server and properties file have been configured, restart the apache tomcat server.
If you open up a web browser and navigate to where your apache-tomcat applications are deployed (often this is localhost:8080) you should see the following:  

![](../res/images/molgenis_home_logged_out.png?raw=true, "molgenis home page")  

Congratulations! You now have your MOLGENIS application up and running. Remember the admin.password you set in the molgenis-server.properties file? Use that password to login as the admin user. The next section will take you through the different modules MOLGENIS has to offer.

# Using maven cargo
The fastest and easiest way to get MOLGENIS running on a machine, is using our cargo project. This is collection of files that you can use to deploy MOLGENIS for you. There are three steps you need to do before this will work: 

**Download the cargo project**

[Download](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-cargo) the entire project from GitHub.

**Setting up your MySQL**  
If you are unfamiliar with MySQL, follow one of their [MySQL installation guides](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/windows-installation.html). Once you have a MySQL server running, login as admin user and type the following commands:

```sql
	create database omx;
	grant all privileges on omx.* to molgenis@localhost identified by 'molgenis';
	flush privileges;
```

If your MySQL has been configured correctly, and your molgenis-server.properties set, then you have to navigate to the location of the cargo and start MOLGENIS with the following command:

```bash
mvn clean resources:resources org.codehaus.cargo:cargo-maven2-plugin:run
```

More details are included in the README of the cargo project.

# Compiling the code

You can also compile the code yourself. See the [Development guide](/develop).

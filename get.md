You can freely copy and install MOLGENIS on your own machines (Licence: LGPLv3). See [Releases](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis/releases) for overview of versions. There are also organisations who can host MOLGENIS for you and provide data management support. And programmers can take MOLGENIS code and customize it. Each option is described below:

# Hosting and support
At least two hosting organisations provide MOLGENIS hosting as a service. E.g. for 200 euro/month UMCG hosts 1 MOLGENIS servers and for 250 euro/month 3 MOLGENIS servers. This includes basic data management support with functional application management. In addition, hosting providers can deliver support on a tailor made basis. Please contact one of the support groups below for details and costs regarding tailored support.

# Install locally using Docker (experimental)

For testing purposes we now use Docker. We have the ambition to also use it for production but then you need to configure data persistence. However feel free to use our docker as a starting point. Get [Docker Images](https://github.com/molgenis/docker)

# Install on server for multiple users and data persistence

If our hosting solution is not suitable and you want to host your own molgenis instance in your own cloud or on prem. Please use our [ansible galaxy repo](https://galaxy.ansible.com/molgenis)

# For programmers
The complete source code of MOLGENIS is open source available at [Github](http://github.com/molgenis/molgenis)

You can find developer documentation as part of the [Manual](https://molgenis.gitbook.io/molgenis/)

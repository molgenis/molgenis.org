You can freely copy and install MOLGENIS on your own machines (Licence: LGPLv3). See [Releases](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis/releases) for overview of versions. There are also organisations who can host MOLGENIS for you and provide data management support. And programmers can take MOLGENIS code and customize it. Each option is described below:

# Hosting and support
Our team provide MOLGENIS hosting as a service. Please contact us for details and costs regarding tailored support:

**Genomics Coordination Center (GCC)**  
University Medical Center Groningen  
email: <molgenis-support@umcg.nl>  


# Install on server for multiple users and data persistence

If our hosting solution is not suitable and you want to host your own molgenis instance in your own cloud or on your own premise. Please take a look at our [ansible galaxy repo](https://galaxy.ansible.com/molgenis) where the setup and requirements are explained.

# Install locally for single user testing with Docker (experimental)

For local testing purposes we provide a Docker image.  Get [Docker Images](https://github.com/molgenis/docker)

# For programmers
The latest incarnation of MOLGENIS is codenamed 'emx2'. The complete documentation and source code of MOLGENIS is open source available at [Github](http://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-emx2)

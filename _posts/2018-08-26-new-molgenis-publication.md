Our researchers, developers and data managers are constantly improving MOLGENIS. The latest efforts are described
in [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty742/5085379).

# Abstract

## Motivation
The volume and complexity of biological data increases rapidly. Many clinical professionals and biomedical researchers without a bioinformatics background are
generating big ’-omics’ data, but do not always have the tools to manage, process or publicly share these data.

## Results
Here we present MOLGENIS Research, an open-source web-application to collect, manage, analyze, visualize and share large and complex biomedical datasets,
without the need for advanced bioinformatics skills.

## Availability and implementation
MOLGENIS Research is freely available (open source software). It can be installed from source code (see [http://github.com/molgenis](http://github.com/molgenis)), downloaded as a 
precompiled
WAR file (for your own server), setup inside a Docker container (see [http://molgenis.github.io](http://molgenis.github.io)), or requested as a Software-as-a-Service subscription. For a
public demo instance and complete installation instructions see [http://molgenis.org/research](http://molgenis.org/research).

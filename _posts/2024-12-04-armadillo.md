## Abstract

Extensive human health data from cohort studies, national registries, and biobanks can reveal lifecourse risk factors impacting health. Combining 
these sources offers increased statistical power, rare outcome detection, replication of findings, and extended study periods. Traditionally, this required data
transfer to a central location or separate partner analyses with pooled summary statistics, posing ethical, legal, and time constraints. Federated
analysis-which involves remote data analysis without sharing individual-level data-is a promising alternative. One promising solution is
DataSHIELD (https://datashield.org/), an open-source R based implementation. To enable federated analysis, data owners need a user-friendly way to install the
federated infrastructure and manage users and data. Here, we present MOLGENIS Armadillo: a lightweight server for federated analysis solutions such as
DataSHIELD. Read more at [Cadman et al, Bioinformatics, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae726)

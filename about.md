The MOLGENIS teams enable new software development, hosting, data management support and advice. In addition we coordinate a wider community of users, sponsors and enthusiasts. We look forward to hear about your experiences with MOLGENIS and suggestions for improvement. Please help us to improve MOLGENIS and send your feedback and ideas to: molgenis-support@umcg.nl. You can also post your ideas open source at [GitHub](https://github.com/molgenis/).

## Coordination
MOLGENIS was initiated and is currently coordinated by [Prof.Dr. Morris Swertz]() of the Genomics Coordination Center ([GCC](https://umcgresearch.org/w/gcc)), 
kindly hosted by the Department of 
Genetics of the University Medical Center Groningen. Please contact at: <a href="mailto:support@molgenis.org">support@molgenis.org</a>. MOLGENIS is funded 
by a large range of public projects from various academic sponsors (see [Partners](/partners.html)).

### Governance
MOLGENIS development is strategically guided by a large list of academic partner projects, the PIs of which provide solicited and unsolicited scientific and strategic advice. Also, they highlight critical issues and emerging global trends in academia where MOLGENIS could fill a gap or meet a need and help the MOLGENIS team to push forward FAIR data and FAIR data stewardship in a national and international context, in particular in human data research, biobanking and rare disease. 

### User groups
In addition to strategic advice MOLGENIS also has several user communities guiding its development. These groups are managed by the respective communities, and often change dynamically following changes in funded project. For example, there is a Dutch biobank user group and a European directory user forum. We plan to expand these user engagement activities to ensure optimal allocation of the limited development resources.

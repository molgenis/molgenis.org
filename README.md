# MOLGENIS.org README

We produce the website using Jekyl. The master branch is automatically build and can be viewed at http://site.dev.molgenis.org
The admin of the website can then push it into production.


# How to develop

Fork this repository and then checkout. On your own machine you should install jekyll. 
In addition need a gem:
 ```gem install bundler jekyll jekyll-feed```

During development you can view changes by running
 ```jekyll server```

To test if your stuff will work in product you can do:
 ```jekyll build``

# Other notes

We colorize SVG icons using Inkscape (where you can select an object and then paste a color onto it, its great)

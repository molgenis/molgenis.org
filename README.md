# MOLGENIS.org README


# !deprecated!
We produce the website using Jekyl. The master branch is automatically build and can be viewed at http://site.dev.molgenis.org . The admin of the website can then push it into production.


# How to develop

Fork this repository and then checkout. On your own machine you should install jekyll. 
Assuming you already have Ruby (ships with Mac):

```
gem install jekyll
```

In addition need a gem:
```gem install bundler jekyll jekyll-feed jekyll-target-blank webrick```

During development you can view changes by running
```jekyll server```

To test if your stuff will work in product you can do:
```jekyll build```

# Other notes

We colorize SVG icons using Inkscape (where you can select an object and then paste a color onto it, its great)

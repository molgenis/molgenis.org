The MOLGENIS teams enable new software development, hosting, data management support and advice. In addition we coordinate a wider community of users, sponsors and enthusiasts. We look forward to hear about your experiences with MOLGENIS and suggestions for improvement. Please help us to improve MOLGENIS and send your feedback and ideas to: molgenis-support@umcg.nl. You can also post your ideas open source at [GitHub](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis/issues).

## Coordination
MOLGENIS was initiated and is currently coordinated by Prof. Dr. Morris Swertz of the Genomics Coordination Center (GCC), kindly hosted by the Department of Genetics of the University Medical Center Groningen. Please contact at: <a href="support@molgenis.org">support@molgenis.org</a>. MOLGENIS is funded by a large range of public projects from various academic sponsors (see Partners below).

**User groups**
In addition to strategic advice MOLGENIS also has several user communities guiding its development. These groups are managed by the respective communities, and often change dynamically following changes in funded project. For example, there is a Dutch biobank user group and a European directory user forum. We plan to expand these user engagement activities to ensure optimal allocation of the limited development resources.

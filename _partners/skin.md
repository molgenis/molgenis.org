[SKIN ERN](https://ern-ithaca.eu/) is the European Reference Network for rare, complex and undiagnosed skin disorders in children and adults.
Most of them are exclusively cutaneous/sub-cutaneous and often present a severe prognosis, because of the intensity of the cutaneous/mucosal involvement, the risk of cancer for some of them, or the frequent multisystemic involvement directly or secondary to skin damages.
MOLGENIS delivers on their [patient registry](https://ern-skin.eu/erras-registry/)

At [INTERCEPT](https://www.intercept-ihi.eu/), we are transforming the landscape of Crohnâ€™s disease research by shifting from reactive symptom management to proactive early detection and
prevention by using biomarkers to identify individuals at risk before symptoms develop, making diagnosis earlier than early. In other words, the aim is to 
stop Crohn's disease. MOLGENIS leads the data infrastructure work package.

The [FAIR genomes project](https://fairgenomes.org/) was initially a Dutch national ZONMW funded national coordination action to unite currently fragmented 
guidelines & 
tools to 
increase ‘FAIR’-ness of DNA 
data -
Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability - uniting work from all types of DNA laboratories (rare disease, cancer, research, etc),
patients/participants organisations, and has extensive collaborations with (inter)national initiatives. Amongst relevant outputs is [NGS semantic metadata data 
schema](https://github.com/fairgenomes/fairgenomes-semantic-model) that 
found its way into other projects such as GDI. Read more on the model in [van der Velde et al (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35418585/) and the 
background in [Belien et al(2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35505836/). MOLGENIS lead the FAIR genomes project (Prof. Morris Swertz). Now FAIR 
genomes lives on as a national collaboration.

UMCG Cohort and Biobank Coordination Hub 
(([CBCH](https://umcgresearch.org/w/umcg-cohort-and-biobank-coordination-hub)) ) 
serves as a central facilitator and linking pin for all UMCG cohort and biobank activities. 
We bring together a community of researchers and clinicians, and provide 
an excellent infrastructure to drive new discoveries. 
Through our network we are able to connect researchers to the right samples, data, people and knowledge.
MOLGENIS contributes through [UMCG Research Data Catalogue](http://umcgresearchdatacatalogue.nl/).
Researchers inside and outside the UMCG can use the Research Data Catalogue to search for sample and data collections relevant for their research. 
You can use the metadata-catalogue to filter on, for example, age groups, data types and available data, such as: lab results, medication and lifestyle.
Besides available samples and data, each individual profile page shows the cohort design, contributors, subcohorts, and collection events.

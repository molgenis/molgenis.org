[EUCAN-Connect](https://eucanconnect.eu) brings together science from Europe and Canada to improve the quality of health care through a more efficient use of 
data.
The project aims to promote collaboration and multidisciplinary research in high-value cohort and molecular data on a large scale. 
As a result statistical power will improve and new discoveries are being facilitated. 
These discoveries will impact human life course and facilitate the translation of the data into personalized diagnostics, treatment and prevention policies.
What is special is that this project focussed on the infrastructure of series of other projects, notably [lifecycle](/partners.html#lifecycle),
[athlete](/partners.html#athlete), [longitools](/partners.html#longitools) and united developers of MOLGENIS catalogue, Maelstrom catalogue and DataSHIELD
federated analysis, greatly hardening their tools for upscaling. MOLGENIS team lead the consortium and participated in all its tasks.

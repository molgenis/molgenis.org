[CRANIO ERN](https://ern-ithaca.eu/) is the European Reference Network for rare and/or complex craniofacial anomalies and ear, nose and throat (ENT) disorders.
Most of them are exclusively cutaneous/sub-cutaneous and often present a severe prognosis, because of the intensity of the cutaneous/mucosal involvement, the risk of cancer for some of them, or the frequent multisystemic involvement directly or secondary to skin damages.
MOLGENIS delivers on their [patient registry](https://www.ern-cranio.eu/ern-cranio-registry/)

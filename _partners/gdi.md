The [Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project](https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/) is enabling access to genomic and related phenotypic and clinical 
data 
across Europe. It is doing this by
establishing a federated, sustainable and secure infrastructure to access the data. It builds on the outputs of the Beyond 1 Million Genomes ([B1MG[(https://b1mg-project.eu/)]) 
project and
is realising the ambition of the 1+Million Genomes ([1+MG](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/1-million-genomes)) initiative. MOLGENIS team 
contributes has lead the pilot site for infrastructure deployment in GDI-NL, lead the report on [semantic interoperability](https://zenodo.org/records/11550316) and co-leads the FAIR data model 
work (Joeri van der Velde).

[BBMRI-ERIC](https://www.bbmri-eric.eu/) is a European research infrastructure for biobanking. BBMRI brings together all the main players from the biobanking field – researchers, 
biobankers, 
industry, and patients – to boost biomedical research. To that end, BBMRI offer quality management services, support with ethical, legal and societal issues, 
and a number of online tools and software solutions for biobankers and researchers. Ultimately, our goal is to make new treatments possible. MOLGENIS 
co-leads [BBMRI services for IT](https://www.bbmri-eric.eu/it/) and leads [BBMRI Directory](https://directory.bbmri-eric.eu/), the broad catalogue of our biobanks with aggregated information 
on EU biobank collections. You can browse and filter by country, sample type, quality marks, ICD-10 and more.

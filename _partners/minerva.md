the MINERVA (Metadata for data dIscoverability aNd study rEplicability in obseRVAtional studies) project ([EUPAS39322](https://catalogues.ema.europa.eu/node/3409/resources)) was initiated in response to the 
HMA–EMA joint Big Data Task Force recommendation on “the identification of metadata” for regulatory decision-making on the choice of data source. 
The MINERVA Consortium included 18 institutions and worked in collaboration with the EMA. MOLGENIS co-lead the metadata model definition and lead the pilot 
implementation for HMA-EMA Catalogues of real-world data sources and studies. 
This project was funded by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) through the framework contract No. EMA/2017/09/PE/16.

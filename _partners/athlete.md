[ATHLETE](https://athleteproject.eu/) (Advancing Tools for Human Early Lifecourse Exposome Research and Translation) is a European-funded project that aims to better understand and 
prevent health effects of numerous environmental hazards and their mixtures, starting from the earliest stages of life. The project aims to develop a human 
exposome toolbox that can be used to evaluate the effects of a large number of environmental exposures in individuals, as well as in communities, in order 
to design policies and interventions to prevent or reduce their health impact. MOLGENIS lead the data infrastructure work package, with focus on the [data 
and harmonisation catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/ATHLETE).

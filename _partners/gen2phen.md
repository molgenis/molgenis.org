[The GEN2PHEN project](https://gen2phen.org/) aims to unify human and model organism genetic variation databases towards increasingly holistic views into Genotype-To-Phenotype (G2P)
data, and to link this system into other biomedical knowledge sources via genome browser functionality. MOLGENIS contributed to data standards and federated 
search, in particular patient/mutation databases and Observ-OM standard. GEN2PHEN is made possible by EU Framework VII grant 200754.

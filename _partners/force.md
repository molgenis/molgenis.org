[FORCE Infrastructure for rare cancers in the Netherlands](https://www.ikdoemeemetforce.nl/over-ons/) is a consortium comprising patients, clinicians, and researchers working collaboratively.
The primary goal of FORCE is to improve treatment outcomes for rare cancers by developing a data warehouse containing clinicopathological data, imaging data,
and a large-scale biobank of samples from donors with rare cancers. This comprehensive repository enables high-quality research on rare cancers. MOLGENIS 
leads the infrastructure development.

[The CINECA project](https://www.cineca-project.eu/) (EU Horizon 825775) aims to establish a common infrastructure for federated data analysis across international 
human 
cohorts, particularly in Europe, Canada,
and Africa, to advance research on common diseases. It focuses on creating a virtual cohort of 1.4 million individuals from population, longitudinal, and disease
studies, enabling federated analyses in the cloud while adhering to ethical and legal standards. The MOLGENIS team contributed working in FAIR standards, in 
collaboration with MOLGENIS catalogue, and 
implementing a reference pipeline for rare disease, what later would become MOLGENIS VIP.

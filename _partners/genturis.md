[GENTURIS ERN](https://www.genturis.eu/) is the European Reference Network for all patients with one of the rare genetic tumour risk syndromes (genturis). The patients with rare genetic tumour risk syndromes are at very high hereditary risk of developing multiple tumours, which are often located in multiple organ systems.
In case they are diagnosed with cancer they may need different treatment and follow-up as compared to non-hereditary cancers. The lifetime risk of cancer can be as high as 100%.
MOLGENIS delivers on their [patient registry](https://www.genturis.eu/l=eng/research/genturis-registry.html)

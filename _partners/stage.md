STAGE is a European Research and Innovation project studying healthy ageing and multi-morbidity using a life-course approach. It tackles the gaps in
knowledge to understand life-long processes and their connections with biological, environmental, social, historical and infrastructural factors. MOLGENIS
leads the Wp9 STAGE lifecourse intelligence portal which is built on MOLGENIS catalogue.
(EU Horizon 101137146). More information: [Project website](https://stage-healthyageing.eu/) - [MOLGENIS catalogue for STAGE](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/STAGE)

[STAGE](https://stage-healthyageing.eu/) is a European Research and Innovation project studying healthy ageing and multi-morbidity using a life-course approach. It tackles the gaps in
knowledge to understand life-long processes and their connections with biological, environmental, social, historical and infrastructural factors. MOLGENIS
leads the WP9 STAGE lifecourse intelligence portal which is built on [MOLGENIS catalogue](https://data-catalogue.molgeniscloud.org/catalogue/catalogue/STAGE).
(EU Horizon 101137146).

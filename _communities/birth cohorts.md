Early life is an important window of opportunity to improve health across the full lifecycle. An accumulating body of evidence suggests that exposure to adverse
stressors during early life leads to developmental adaptations, which subsequently affect disease risk in later life. Also, geographical, socio-economic, and
ethnic differences are related to health inequalities from early life onwards. To address these important public health challenges, many European pregnancy and
childhood cohorts have been established over the last 30 years. The enormous wealth of data of these cohorts has led to important new biological insights and
important impact for health from early life onwards. The impact of these cohorts and their data could be further increased by combining data from different
cohorts. Combining data will lead to the possibility of identifying smaller effect estimates, and the opportunity to better identify risk groups and risk
factors leading to disease across the lifecycle across countries. Also, it enables research on better causal understanding and modelling of life course health
trajectories. The EU Child Cohort Network, established by the Horizon2020-funded LifeCycle Project, brings together nineteen pregnancy and childhood cohorts,
together including more than 250,000 children and their parents.

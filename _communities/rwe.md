Pharmacoepidemiologic researchers have for decades used real-world data and generated real-world evidence (RWE) to support regulatory decision-making on medicines. 
For many stakeholders, increased data discoverability can have a clear, positive impact; it allows more efficient and higher-quality studies and enhances 
the transparency and reproducibility of data.
Using MOLGENIS we aim to provide FAIR data catalogues to optimize description of RWE/RWD datasets to help improve health of all citizens.

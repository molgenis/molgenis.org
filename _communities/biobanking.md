MOLGENIS work with individual biobanks and networks across Europe, coordinated by BBMRI-ERIC the European research infrastructure for biobanking. BBMRI-ERIC
brings together all the main players from the biobanking field – researchers, biobankers, industry, and patients – to boost biomedical research. MOLGENIS contributes to IT services for individual biobanks and

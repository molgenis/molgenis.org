Our cancer communities propose to set up National and European Federated Cancer Research data hubs and to generate a series of use cases, addressing major
challenges in cancer research. These ambitious and innovative, but realistic and focussed, use cases will be cross-border and trans-disciplinary research
programmes built in a problem-solving manner. Results of these use cases will feed the Cancer Research data hub with findable, accessible, interoperable, and
re-usable (FAIR) cancer research data.

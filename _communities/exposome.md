Unhealthy environments contribute to about three quarters of the global burden of disease. Exposure to air pollution and harmful chemicals, or a lack of access
to a balanced diet or green spaces like city parks, are examples of factors that can negatively impact health and potentially increase the risk of developing
various diseases.
The human exposome refers to the integrated compilation of all the physical, chemical, biological and psychosocial factors, and their interactions, which have
an impact on biology and health. This approach to studying environmental pollution is groundbreaking because it allows researchers to explore multiple types of
exposure at the same time and their impact on health.
Research on the exposome is paramount to better understand the causal pathways leading to common diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases,
immunological disorders, and non-communicable diseases. As a result, exposome research has the potential to answer key questions about how environmental
exposures are associated with the development of disease.
